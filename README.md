# flask_auth
This project tries out creating a login app using Flask. The code is referenced from the tutorial found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login).

In addition, [Flask Bootstrap](https://bootstrap-flask.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used in order to use Boostrap to style the webpages.
